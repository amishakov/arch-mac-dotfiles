# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles

I mainly work with [Go](https://golang.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and [shell scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) so my setup is geared towards working with these technologies.

## Installation

1. Run the following command:

    ```shell
    $ bash <(curl -s http://mywebsite.com/myscript.txt)
    ```

1. Run command again if Xcode Command Line Tools needed to be installed

## Usage

* `pacu`: Installs everything in `Brewfile` and removes everything else
* `nvim`: Starts neovim with all plugins
* and many more...
